# Gadgets
**System monitoring gadgets inspired by the well-known AddGadgets.com Windows Sidebar gadgets.**

Arguably, some of the best and most popular Vista and Windows 7 Gadgets for system monitoring were done by [AddGadgets.com](http://addgadgets.com/). Unfortunately, with the deprecation of the Gadget platform and outright banning of gadgets by some corporate policies, these gadgets have become obsolete. Gadgets aren't supported in Windows 8 or Windows 10 without hacks and workarounds and often they break after applying Windows Updates.

I've searched everywhere to find equivalent gadgets, and finally found one on the Rainmeter forums, the "All CPU Meter" skin, by James Musix. The skin never made it out of beta, so I've completed his original work and expanded the suite to include a number of the most widely used AddGadgets.com gadgets.

**[Download the latest version here (5.5.1)](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets/releases/download/v5.5.1/Gadgets_5.5.1.rmskin)**
